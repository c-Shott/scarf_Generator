# Scarf Generator
This is a script to generate a pattern for [this scarf](https://knitting-and-so-on.blogspot.com/2015/05/random-lace-scarf.html). More information can be found on my [blog](https://connorshott.xyz)

## Running
Determine the rows per inch your yarn packaging has and enter that after running
> lua pattern.lua
in your command line. You will get an output in pdf.

## Notes

If on linux, there shouldnt be any issues as GNU Roff is preinstalled. If LaTeX is preferred, uncomment the noted lines in the **writePattern** function.
